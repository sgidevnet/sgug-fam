# sgug-fam

A drop-in replacement for the IRIX libfam library that can be built with
GNU C++ compilers - and so avoids a breaking dependency on MIPSPro C++
libraries.

## Licensing

The sgug-fam library and source code come from the LGPL/GPL fam release made by SGI and available here:

https://cvs.savannah.nongnu.org/viewvc/fam/

## What/How to build

Normally you'll get this as part of the sgug-rse project, go check there.
